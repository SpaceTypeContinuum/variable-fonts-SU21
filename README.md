## Course Description

Variable fonts have been a topic of growing curiosity in the type world â€” but how do we use them on the web? Have you ever thought about building your own variable type tester, or wondered how they could be brought to life through code?

Over four evenings, this beginner-friendly course will cover the fundamentals of programming using both HTML+CSS web basics and P5.js, a beginner-friendly Javascript framework. Weâ€™ll explore how to utilize these tools with variable fonts to create interesting digital experiences, opening new doors and finding fresh avenues for experimentation â€¦ and fun!

This is an intermediate level course, and students are expected to have a basic knowledge of programming concepts and the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. P5.js will be the main programming library for the course, a beginner-friendly Javascript framework. 

Techniques covered in this course will include time and interaction-based CSS manipulation and animation on the web using variable font features.
